I recently attended a collection of sessions on creating generative art using processing (open source tool for generative art using java ) at cocoon culture center located @cairo , So I took the chance and delved into P5.js which is JavaScript library for creative coding as well but for web .
I wanted to make a react PWA(progressive web app) so i used react-p5 wich is a npm package for p5 to use it within your React app to create this website , which serves as
<li> a online exhibtion to the offline one that was held @ cairo .</li>
<li>but thats not all if you click on "play with me " button  it will take you to a new canvas with  moving/interactive generative art created in your browser thanks to p5 and react-p5 ..</li>

I used special css library called "98.css" which made alot of the styling much much easier.
I also used cards from material ui to implement the gallary section.
<br></br>
The whole theme is inspired by win98 and this was me trying to simulate and create my own version as you can see.(the reson for the whole retro theme as i have been playing a lot of old nostalgic games on my switch lately so that was the first thing came to my mind :D )

 
 ## how to use it :
 <li>click on "cocoon.exe" and check the online exhibtion to see some generative art works by 5 amazing artists (including me) with thier instagram accounts linked .</li>

<li>click on "play with me " it will take you to a new canvas with moving/interactive generative art created in your browser thanks to p5 and react-p5 (touch your screen to change pattern).</li>
